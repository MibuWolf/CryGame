		// - Certain modification commands (such as CAddAttachmentObject) contain specialized control paths for CA_CharEditModel
		//   that may end up in a recursive CModificationCommandBuffer flush. This can cause a whole range of various mean things,
		//   including but not limited to stack overflows and calling methods on dangling pointers.
		// - CModificationCommandBuffer is currently not flushed when user interacts continuously with the CT model
		//   (e.g. dragging attachments around), which ends up with buffer overflows.
		//
		// There's no point in buffering modification commands in the character edit mode anyway, so we simply reverted to the old synchronous behavior as an ad-hoc fix.
		// Ideally, the attachment management code should be redesigned from the ground up to get rid of the massive technical debt and properly account for current, more dynamic use cases.
