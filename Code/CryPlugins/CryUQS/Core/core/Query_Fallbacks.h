		// - all item-monitors of the one child that came up with the result set will be transferred to ourself, so that these item-monitors will bubble up in the hierarchy and keep monitoring
		// - for children that failed to deliver items, we don't care about their item-monitors as they don't have a saying on the final items anyway
