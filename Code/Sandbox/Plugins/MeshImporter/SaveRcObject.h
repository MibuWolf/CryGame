// Here, saving a RC object means creating a data file, such as CGF or SKIN, by running the RC on a
// (temporary) meta-data file.
// Saving a RC object is a two-phase process. Firstly, we capture all necessary state that is going
// to be passed to the RC. Secondly, this state is passed to an actual call of the RC, which will
// run asynchronously.
// The general idea is that all relevant state is copied before tasks are launched asynchronously,
// so that consistency is guaranteed.
